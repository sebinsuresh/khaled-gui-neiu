Improvements:

- Label: Setter codes are not being used in Label & device classes.

- SpaceMan: Move all "create__" code to top, all the functionality code (listeners, illustration updation) to bottom

- Order functions alphabetically

- JSDocs for all functions, classes, class properties

- Using const and '===' wherever valid

- Allowing for other controller device classes than RPi. Right now all connection code is hardcoded to check for "RPI".
