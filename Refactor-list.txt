Improvements:

- Implement all TODOs

- SpaceManager's connectDevices() and disconnectDevices() have some functionality that can be moved to Device and RPi class
	- connectDevice's "setting pin number" part
	- part where various properties of the device objects (.connectedDevices, .isConnected, .connectedTo) etc are set
	- disconnectDevice's code to do the same ^

- RPi: Add function to check if RPi has device at specific pin number
	- Use this within areDevicesConnectable() in SpaceMan

- Label: Setter codes are not being used in Label & device classes.

- SpaceMan: Move all "create__" code to top, all the functionality code (listeners, illustration updation) to bottom

- Order functions alphabetically

- JSDocs for all functions, classes, class properties

- Allowing for other controller device classes than RPi. Right now all connection code is hardcoded to check for "RPI".
